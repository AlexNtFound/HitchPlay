## Description
HitchPlay allows users to control the Rover through an Android App in multiple ways. 
You can give instructions by voice, which the Android app's LLM will translate into ROS commands and send to Rover. 
You can use the joystick to control the Rover manually. 
Or you can send ROS commands directly in the terminal page of the Android App.
